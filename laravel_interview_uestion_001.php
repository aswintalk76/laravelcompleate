laravel interview question and answer

1) What is the Laravel?

A) Laravel is an open-source PHP web framework, created for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.


2) What is Laravel Horizon?

A) Laravel Horizon provides a beautiful dashboard and code-driven configuration for your Redis queues.

3) What is Laravel Dusk?


A) Laravel Dusk provides an expressive, easy-to-use browser automation and testing API. You’ll love it.

4) What is Laravel Echo?

A) Event broadcasting, evolved. Bring the power of WebSockets to your application without the complexity.


5) How do you install Laravel?

A) Laravel utilizes Composer to manage its dependencies. So, before using Laravel, make sure we have Composer installed on your machine.

6) What is Composer Tool?

A) Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

7) What is Laravel service container?

A) The Laravel service container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection. Dependency injection is a fancy phrase that essentially means this: class dependencies are “injected” into the class via the constructor or, in some cases, “setter” methods.

8) What is Binding?

A) Within a service provider, we always have access to the container via the $this->app property. We can register a binding using the bind method, passing the class or interface name that we wish to register along with a Closure that returns an instance of the class:

$this->app->bind(‘HelpSpot\API’, function ($app) {
return new HelpSpot\API($app->make(‘HttpClient’));
});

9) Explain Binding A Singleton?

A) The singleton method binds a class or interface into the container that should only be resolved one time. Once a singleton binding is resolved, the same object instance will be returned on subsequent calls into the container.

10) Explain Binding Instances?

A) You may also bind an existing object instance into the container using the instance method. The given instance will always be returned on subsequent calls into the container:

$api = new HelpSpot\API(new HttpClient);

$this->app->instance(‘HelpSpot\API’, $api);

Laravel Interview Questions # 11) Explain Binding Primitives?

A) Sometimes you may have a class that receives some injected classes, but also needs an injected primitive value such as an integer. You may easily use contextual binding to inject any value your class may need:

$this->app->when(‘App\Http\Controllers\UserController’)
->needs(‘$variableName’)
->give($value);

Laravel Interview Questions # 12) Explain Contextual Binding and how does it work?

A) Sometimes you may have two classes that utilize the same interface, but you wish to inject different implementations into each class. For example, two controllers may depend on different implementations of the Illuminate\Contracts\Filesystem\Filesystem contract. Laravel provides a simple, fluent interface for defining this behavior:

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;
use App\Http\Controllers\PhotoController;
use App\Http\Controllers\VideoController;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Filesystem\Filesystem;

$this->app->when(PhotoController::class)
->needs(Filesystem::class)
->give(function () {
return Storage::disk(‘local’);
});

$this->app->when(VideoController::class)
->needs(Filesystem::class)
->give(function () {
return Storage::disk(‘s3’);
});

Laravel Interview Questions # 13) What is Tagging?

A) Occasionally, you may need to resolve all of a certain “category” of binding. For example, perhaps you are building a report aggregator that receives an array of many different Report interface implementations. After registering the Report implementations, you can assign them a tag using the tag method:

$this->app->bind(‘SpeedReport’, function () {
//
});

$this->app->bind(‘MemoryReport’, function () {
//
});

$this->app->tag([‘SpeedReport’, ‘MemoryReport’], ‘reports’);
Once the services have been tagged, you may easily resolve them all via the tagged method:

$this->app->bind(‘ReportAggregator’, function ($app) {
return new ReportAggregator($app->tagged(‘reports’));
});

Laravel Interview Questions # 14) Explain Extending Bindings?

A) The extend method allows the modification of resolved services. For example, when a service is resolved, you may run additional code to decorate or configure the service. The extend method accepts a Closure, which should return the modified service, as its only argument:

$this->app->extend(Service::class, function($service) {
return new DecoratedService($service);
});

Laravel Interview Questions # 15) What is the make Method?

A) You may use the make method to resolve a class instance out of the container. The make method accepts the name of the class or interface you wish to resolve:

$api = $this->app->make(‘HelpSpot\API’);

Laravel Interview Questions # 16) What are service providers?

A) Service providers are the central place of all Laravel application bootstrapping. Your own application, as well as all of Laravel’s core services are bootstrapped via service providers.

Laravel Interview Questions # 17) What is Register Method?

A) within the register method, you should only bind things into the service container. You should never attempt to register any event listeners, routes, or any other piece of functionality within the register method.

Laravel Interview Questions # 18) Explain the bindings And singletons Properties?

A) If your service provider registers many simple bindings, you may wish to use the bindings and singletons properties instead of manually registering each container binding. When the service provider is loaded by the framework, it will automatically check for these properties and register their bindings

Laravel Interview Questions # 19) What is the Boot Method?

A) if we need to register a view composer within our service provider? This should be done within the boot method. This method is called after all other service providers have been registered, meaning you have access to all other services that have been registered by the framework.

Laravel Interview Questions # 20) Where do you register service providers?

A) All service providers are registered in the config/app.php configuration file. This file contains a providers array where you can list the class names of your service providers.

PHP Laravel Interview Questions And Answers
Laravel Interview Questions # 21) How do you register service providers?

A) To register your provider, add it to the array:

‘providers’ => [
// Other Service Providers

App\Providers\ComposerServiceProvider::class,
],

Laravel Interview Questions # 22) What are Facades?

A) Facades provide a “static” interface to classes that are available in the application’s service container.

Laravel Interview Questions # 23) Where Laravel’s facades are defined?

A) All of Laravel’s facades are defined in the Illuminate\Support\Facades namespace

Laravel Interview Questions # 24) What are the benefits of Facades?

A) Facades have many benefits. They provide a terse, memorable syntax that allows you to use Laravel’s features without remembering long class names that must be injected or configured manually. Furthermore, because of their unique usage of PHP’s dynamic methods, they are easy to test.

Laravel Interview Questions # 25) Difference between Facades Vs. Dependency Injection?

A) One of the primary benefits of dependency injection is the ability to swap implementations of the injected class. This is useful during testing since you can inject a mock or stub and assert that various methods were called on the stub.

Typically, it would not be possible to mock or stub a truly static class method. However, since facades use dynamic methods to proxy method calls to objects resolved from the service container, we actually can test facades just as we would test an injected class instance.

Laravel Interview Questions # 26) What is the difference between Facades Vs Helper Functions?

A) In addition to facades, Laravel includes a variety of “helper” functions which can perform common tasks like generating views, firing events, dispatching jobs, or sending HTTP responses. Many of these helper functions perform the same function as a corresponding facade.

Laravel Interview Questions # 27) What are Laravel’s Contracts?

A) Laravel’s Contracts are a set of interfaces that define the core services provided by the framework. For example, a Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\Queue contract defines the methods needed for queueing jobs, while the Illuminate\Contracts\Mail\Mailer contract defines the methods needed for sending e-mail.

Laravel Interview Questions # 28) What is the difference between Contracts Vs Facades?

A) Laravel’s facades and helper functions provide a simple way of utilizing Laravel’s services without needing to type-hint and resolve contracts out of the service container. In most cases, each facade has an equivalent contract.

Unlike facades, which do not require you to require them in your class’ constructor, contracts allow you to define explicit dependencies for your classes. Some developers prefer to explicitly define their dependencies in this way and therefore prefer to use contracts, while other developers enjoy the convenience of facades.

Laravel Interview Questions # 29) What is Routing in Laravel?

A) The most basic Laravel routes accept a URI and a Closure, providing a very simple and expressive method of defining routes:

Route::get(‘foo’, function () {
return ‘Hello World’;
});


Laravel Interview Questions # 30) Where do you locate Route files?

A) All Laravel routes are defined in your route files, which are located in the routes directory.

Laravel PHP Developer Interview Questions
Laravel Interview Questions # 31) What are the available Router Methods?

A) The router allows you to register routes that respond to any HTTP verb:

Route::get($uri, $callback);
Route::post($uri, $callback);
Route::put($uri, $callback);
Route::patch($uri, $callback);
Route::delete($uri, $callback);
Route::options($uri, $callback);

Laravel Interview Questions # 32) What is CSRF Protection?

A) aravel makes it easy to protect your application from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. Cross-site request forgeries are a type of malicious exploit whereby unauthorized commands are performed on behalf of an authenticated user.

Laravel Interview Questions # 33) What is CSRF Protection Token?

A) Any HTML forms pointing to POST, PUT, or DELETE routes that are defined in the web routes file should include a CSRF token field. Otherwise, the request will be rejected.

<form method=”POST” action=”/profile”>
@csrf
…
</form>

Laravel Interview Questions # 34) What is Redirect Routes?

A) If you are defining a route that redirects to another URI, you may use the Route::redirect method.

Route::redirect(‘/here’, ‘/there’, 301);

Laravel Interview Questions # 35) What is View Routes?

A) If your route only needs to return a view, you may use the Route:: view method. The view method accepts a URI as its first argument and a view name as its second argument. In addition, you may provide an array of data to pass to the view as an optional third argument.

Route::view(‘/welcome’, ‘welcome’);

Route::view(‘/welcome’, ‘welcome’, [‘name’ => ‘Taylor’]);

Laravel Interview Questions # 36) What is Named Routes?

A) Named routes allow the convenient generation of URLs or redirects for specific routes. You may specify a name for a route by chaining the name method onto the route definition:

Route::get(‘user/profile’, function () {
//
})->name(‘profile’);

Laravel Interview Questions # 37) What are Route Groups?

A) Route groups allow you to share route attributes, such as middleware or namespaces, across a large number of routes without needing to define those attributes on each individual route.

38) What is Route Model Binding?

A) When injecting a model ID to a route or controller action, you will often query to retrieve the model that corresponds to that ID. Laravel route model binding provides a convenient way to automatically inject the model instances directly into your routes.

Laravel Interview Questions # 39) What is Rate Limiting?

A) Laravel includes a middleware to rate limit access to routes within your application. To get started, assign the throttle middleware to a route or a group of routes.

The throttle middleware accepts two parameters that determine the maximum number of requests that can be made in a given number of minutes. For example, let’s specify that an authenticated user may access the following group of routes 60 times per minute:

Route::middleware(‘auth:api’, ‘throttle:60,1’)->group(function () {
Route::get(‘/user’, function () {
//
});
});

Laravel Interview Questions # 40) What is Middleware?

A) Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application.

Advanced Laravel Interview Questions And Answers
41) How do you define Middleware?

A) To create a new middleware, use the make:middleware Artisan command:

php artisan make:middleware CheckAge

This command will place a new CheckAge class within your app/Http/Middleware directory.

42) What are Middleware Groups?

A) Sometimes you may want to group several middleware under a single key to make them easier to assign to routes. You may do this using the $middlewareGroups property of your HTTP kernel.

43) What is X-CSRF-TOKEN?

A) In addition to checking for the CSRF token as a POST parameter, the VerifyCsrfToken middleware will also check for the X-CSRF-TOKEN request header. You could, for example, store the token in a HTML meta tag:

<meta name=”csrf-token” content=”{{ csrf_token() }}”>

44) What is X-XSRF-TOKEN?

A) Laravel stores the current CSRF token in a XSRF-TOKEN cookie that is included with each response generated by the framework. You can use the cookie value to set the X-XSRF-TOKEN request header.

45) What is Response in Laravel?

A) All routes and controllers should return a response to be sent back to the user’s browser. Laravel provides several different ways to return responses. The most basic response is returning a string from a route or controller. The framework will automatically convert the string into a full HTTP response:

Route::get(‘/’, function () {
return ‘Hello World’;
});

46) What are Redirect responses?

A) Redirect responses are instances of the Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse class, and contain the proper headers needed to redirect the user to another URL. There are several ways to generate a RedirectResponse instance. The simplest method is to use the global redirect helper:

Route::get(‘dashboard’, function () {
return redirect(‘home/dashboard’);
});

47) What is Response Macros?

A) If you would like to define a custom response that you can re-use in a variety of your routes and controllers, you may use the macro method on the Response facade.

48) What is View?

A) Views contain the HTML served by your application and separate your controller / application logic from your presentation logic. Views are stored in the resources/views directory. A simple view might look something like this:

<!– View stored in resources/views/greeting.blade.php –>

<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello, {{ $name }}</h1>
</body>
</html>

48) What are View Composers?

A) View composers are callbacks or class methods that are called when a view is rendered. If you have data that you want to be bound to a view each time that view is rendered, a view composer can help you organize that logic into a single location.

49) What are View Creators?

A) View creators are very similar to view composers; however, they are executed immediately after the view is instantiated instead of waiting until the view is about to render. To register a view creator, use the creator method:

View::creator(‘profile’, ‘App\Http\ViewCreators\ProfileCreator’);

50) How do you generate URLs?

A) Laravel provides several helpers to assist you in generating URLs for your application. Of course, these are mainly helpful when building links in your templates and API responses, or when generating redirect responses to another part of your application.

Laravel Interview Questions For 2, 3, 4, 5 Years Experience
51) What is url helper?

A) The url helper may be used to generate arbitrary URLs for your application. The generated URL will automatically use the scheme (HTTP or HTTPS) and host from the current request:

$post = App\Post::find(1);

echo url(“/posts/{$post->id}”);

// https://example.com/posts/1

52) Exceptions are handled by which class?

A) All exceptions in Laravel are handled by the App\Exceptions\Handler class. This class contains two methods: report and render.

53) What is report method?

A) The report method is used to log exceptions or send them to an external service like Bugsnag or Sentry. By default, the report method passes the exception to the base class where the exception is logged. However, you are free to log exceptions however you wish.

54) What is the render method?

A) The render methos is responsible for converting a given exception into an HTTP response that should be sent back to the browser. By default, the exception is passed to the base class which generates a response for you.

55) What are HTTP Exceptions?

A) Some exceptions describe HTTP error codes from the server. For example, this may be a “page not found” error (404), an “unauthorized error” (401) or even a developer generated 500 error.

56) What is Monolog library?

A) Laravel utilizes the Monolog library, which provides support for a variety of powerful log handlers. Laravel makes it a cinch to configure these handlers, allowing you to mix and match them to customize your application’s log handling.

57) What is stack channel?

A) By default, Laravel will use the stack channel when logging messages. The stack channel is used to aggregate multiple log channels into a single channel.

58) What are Blade Templates?

A) Blade is the simple, yet powerful templating engine provided with Laravel. Unlike other popular PHP templating engines, Blade does not restrict you from using plain PHP code in your views.

59) Where is the authentication configuration file is located in Laravel?

A) The authentication configuration file is located at config/auth.php, which contains several well documented options for tweaking the behavior of the authentication services.

60) What is fluent query builder in Laravel?

A) Laravel’s database query builder provides a convenient, fluent interface to creating and running database queries. It can be used to perform most database operations in your application and works on all supported database systems.

The Laravel query builder uses PDO parameter binding to protect your application against SQL injection attacks. There is no need to clean strings being passed as bindings.

61) What is Eloquent ORM in Laravel?

The Eloquent ORM included with Laravel provides a beautiful, simple ActiveRecord implementation for working with your database. Each database table has a corresponding “Model” which is used to interact with that table. Models allow you to query for data in your tables, as well as insert new records into the table.

62) Laravle supports which databases?

A) Laravel makes interacting with databases extremely simple across a variety of database backends using either raw SQL, the fluent query builder, and the Eloquent ORM. Currently, Laravel supports four databases:

MySQL
PostgreSQL
SQLite
SQL Server

63) Where do you locate database configuration file?

A) The database configuration for your application is located at config/database.php. In this file you may define all of your database connections, as well as specify which connection should be used by default.

64) What is Redis?

A) Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets.

65) Can you explain about Serialization?

A) When building JSON APIs, you will often need to convert your models and relationships to arrays or JSON. Eloquent includes convenient methods for making these conversions, as well as controlling which attributes are included in your serializations.

Serializing To Arrays – To convert a model and its loaded relationships to an array, you should use the toArray method.

$user = App\User::with(‘roles’)->first();

return $user->toArray();

You may also convert entire collections of models to arrays:

$users = App\User::all();

Serializing To JSON – To convert a model to JSON, you should use the toJson method. Like toArray, the toJson method is recursive, so all attributes and relations will be converted to JSON:

$user = App\User::find(1);

return $user->toJson();

return $users->toArray();
